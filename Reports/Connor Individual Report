Once we had set up our GitHub repo my team had a teams call in order to discuss the duties we would all have. I was responsible for creating the “Adopt-A-Pet” page on our website and in doing so also created the name of the website too. I found the use of GitHub as a VCS very good, it allowed my team to all independently work on different pages of the website in the Dev branch. Then once satisfied with the changes made, they could then be pushed into the Main branch. This also allowed for peer reviewing of the updates to the page which was critical in our way of working to ensure that everyone was on the same page and nothing got broken. This ability also helps to leave an evidence trail showing what pull requests have happened when, by who, and what was changed. Meaning that in the case of an error it can be traced back and resolved easily. To me using GitHub was an amazing experience and this basic project has allowed me to understand the ways in which GitHub and other VCS can be used effectively to manage multiple developments happening simultaneously and making sure that when a pull request is made to move into the main branch that nothing will be broken as a result. I hope to be able to use GitHub again in future projects due to how effortlessly me and my team were able to complete this task using it.
