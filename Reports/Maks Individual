Overall, I'm happy with how the project went. It helped me learn a great deal about GitHub, from simply playing around with all the features available to use.
I started by creating the repo for my group, and our group of five strong set up meetings on teams to divide the workload. These sessions were important so we could make sure everyone had an even and manageable amount of work to do. After we created a home page based on a pet rescue, we assigned ourselves 5 different pages to work on, with myself going for the “About Us” page. After spending a little time on some pseudocode resembling HTML, we looked into using the GitHub features.
We made sure everyone had access by inviting them as collaborators, and then created two branches called main and dev. Our plan was to have all our changes on dev, what would act as our backup and developer space, before activating a pull request, to take all changes from dev to main when we were ready to commit. There were procedures in place so we could check over somebody else’s commits, before they were committed onto main, which acted as our live website.
The whole project gave us a good idea on version control and managing tasks within a team. Everyone had a fair portion of work to do, and we maintained communication throughout the week in case we had any problems.
Next time I use GitHub for a project, some things to approve upon are to learn more features, as we only really used branching, commits, pull requests, commenting, and forks. There’s likely some common practices for us to learn so we can use GitHub in an efficient way.
